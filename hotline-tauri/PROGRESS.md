### 2025-12-11: Transaction Fix & Server Window UI

**What was completed:**
- Fixed critical bug in transaction encoding (totalSize/dataSize were incorrectly calculated)
- Successfully tested connection to live server (hotline.semihosted.xyz:5500)
- Implemented Server Window UI with chat interface
- Wired up Connect button in bookmark list to open server windows
- Added server state management (activeServers, serverInfo map)
- Implemented chat message sending

**Bug Fix Details:**
- **Problem**: Login transaction was hanging - server wasn't responding
- **Root Cause**: Transaction header had `totalSize = HEADER_SIZE + data_size` when it should be `totalSize = data_size`
- **Fix**: Both `totalSize` and `dataSize` fields now correctly contain only the length of field data (not including the 20-byte header)
- **File**: `src-tauri/src/protocol/transaction.rs:127-128`

**Connection Flow:**
1. User clicks "Connect" on bookmark in TrackerWindow
2. `connect_to_server` command creates HotlineClient and calls `connect()`
3. Client performs TCP handshake (TRTP+HOTL) then login transaction
4. On success, server ID added to activeServers and ServerWindow opens
5. User can send chat messages via the chat input

**Files created/modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/transaction.rs` - Fixed totalSize calculation
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - NEW: Chat UI with send functionality
- `src/components/tracker/BookmarkList.tsx` - Added connect handler
- `src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added serverInfo Map for tracking server details
- `src/App.tsx` - Routes between TrackerWindow and ServerWindow

**Testing Status:**
- ✅ Connection to hotline.semihosted.xyz:5500 successful
- ✅ Handshake and login working
- ✅ Server window opens and displays
- ✅ Chat messages can be sent
- ⏸️ Chat message receiving not yet implemented

**Next task:** Implement chat message receiving with Tauri events

### 2025-12-11: Chat Message Receiving & Display

**What was completed:**
- Event forwarding from Rust backend to frontend via Tauri events
- Chat message receiving and display in real-time
- Visual distinction between own messages (green) and others (blue)
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Message timestamp tracking

**Files modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/state/mod.rs` - Added event forwarding task that emits Tauri events
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added event listeners and message display

**Implementation details:**
- Backend spawns tokio task to forward HotlineClient events to frontend
- Uses Tauri's `app_handle.emit()` to send events with server-specific channels
- Frontend listens to `chat-message-{serverId}` events
- Messages stored in component state and displayed in scrollable list
- Own messages added immediately on send (server doesn't echo back)

**Next task:** Fix chat message sending (messages were hanging)

### 2025-12-11: TCP Stream Splitting Fix

**What was completed:**
- Fixed critical deadlock issue where chat messages would hang
- Split TcpStream into separate read/write halves for concurrent access
- Updated all client methods to use split streams
- Messages now send immediately without blocking

**Bug Fix Details:**
- **Problem**: Chat messages would hang when sent, only appearing after disconnect
- **Root Cause**: Receive loop held stream lock while blocked on read, preventing send from acquiring lock
- **Solution**: Split TcpStream using `into_split()` to create OwnedReadHalf and OwnedWriteHalf
- **Impact**: Send and receive operations can now happen concurrently

**Files modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client.rs` - Complete refactor of stream management
  - Changed from `stream: Arc<Mutex<Option<TcpStream>>>`
  - To `read_half` and `write_half` as separate Arc<Mutex<>> fields
  - Updated all methods: connect, handshake, login, disconnect, receive_loop, keepalive, send_chat

**Next task:** Implement user list

### 2025-12-11: User List Implementation

**What was completed:**
- GetUserNameList transaction to request connected users
- UserNameWithInfo field parsing (user ID, icon ID, username)
- Real-time user list display in sidebar
- User join/leave/change event handling
- User count display in header

**Files modified:**
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added User interface, state, and event listeners
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client.rs` - Added get_user_list() method and parse_user_info() helper
- `src-tauri/src/state/mod.rs` - Added event forwarding for UserJoined, UserLeft, UserChanged

**Implementation details:**
- GetUserNameList (transaction type 300) sent after login
- Server replies with UserNameWithInfo fields containing 8-byte header + username
- Each user parsed and emitted as UserJoined event
- Frontend displays users with icon IDs and names in sidebar
- Real-time updates as users join, leave, or change info

**Next task:** File browsing

### 2025-12-11: File Browsing Implementation

**What was completed:**
- Tabbed interface (Chat / Files) in ServerWindow
- GetFileNameList transaction (type 200)
- FileNameWithInfo field parsing (20-byte header format)
- File and folder display with icons
- Breadcrumb path navigation
- Double-click folder navigation
- FilePath encoding for nested folder access

**Files created/modified:**
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added Files tab, file list UI, breadcrumb navigation
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client.rs` - Added get_file_list(), parse_file_info(), FileInfo struct, FileList event
- `src-tauri/src/state/mod.rs` - Added get_file_list() method and FileList event forwarding
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Added get_file_list command
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Registered get_file_list command

**Implementation details:**
- FileNameWithInfo format: 4 bytes type + 4 bytes creator + 4 bytes size + 4 bytes reserved + 2 bytes flags + 2 bytes name_len + name
- FilePath encoding: 2 bytes count + for each: [0x00, 0x00] separator + 1 byte length + name
- Files vs folders detected by type field "fldr"
- Real-time file list updates on path changes
- Breadcrumb navigation for easy path traversal

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed FilePath encoding (needed separator bytes and single-byte length)
- Fixed React duplicate key warning (using file.name instead of index)
- Fixed double-click event propagation

**Testing:**
- Successfully navigated Apple Archive → 1980s → '80 → video files
- File sizes correctly displayed
- Folder navigation working smoothly

**Next task:** File downloads or other features

### 2025-12-11: Tailwind CSS v3 Integration

**What was completed:**
- Fixed Tailwind CSS not rendering (downgraded from v4 to v3)
- Configured PostCSS with CommonJS module format
- All UI styles now rendering correctly

**Bug Fix Details:**
- **Problem**: Tailwind classes attached but CSS not rendering
- **Root Cause**: Tailwind v4 has different PostCSS integration requirements
- **Solution**: Downgraded to Tailwind v3, renamed postcss.config.js to .cjs, added CSS import to main.tsx

**Files modified:**
- `package.json` - Downgraded tailwindcss to v3
- `postcss.config.cjs` - Renamed from .js, uses module.exports
- `src/main.tsx` - Added `import "./App.css"`

### 2025-12-11: File Download Fixes & Progress Indicator

**What was completed:**
- Fixed FILP header parsing (corrected to 24 bytes from incorrect 16 bytes)
- Fixed file transfer port (using port+1 as per protocol spec)
- Fixed file transfer handshake format (HTXF + ref_num + 0 + 0 = 16 bytes)
- Fixed DATA fork size handling (use file list size when fork header shows 0)
- Implemented download progress indicator with throttled updates
- Support for multiple simultaneous file downloads

**Bug Fix Details:**
- **FILP Header Structure**: Format (4) + version (2) + reserved (16) + fork count (2) = 24 bytes total
  - Previously was reading only 16 bytes, causing fork headers to be read 8 bytes too early
  - Fork type "INFO" was appearing in wrong position
- **File Transfer Port**: File transfers use server port + 1 (e.g., 5501 for main port 5500)
  - Discovered from Swift reference code (HotlineFileDownloadClient.swift:138)
- **Handshake Format**: HTXF (4) + referenceNumber (4) + 0 (4) + 0 (4) = 16 bytes
  - Not 20 bytes as initially attempted
- **DATA Fork Size**: Some servers send DATA fork with size=0 in header
  - Fall back to file list size (from FileNameWithInfo) when fork header shows 0
  - Log warning when sizes don't match for debugging

**Files modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client.rs` - Fixed FILP header (24 bytes), added chunked reading with progress callback
- `src-tauri/src/state/mod.rs` - Added progress event emission with filename
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added progress bar UI with per-file tracking

**Implementation details:**
- **Progress tracking**: Reads data in 64KB chunks, emits progress every 2% to avoid UI stuttering
- **Multiple downloads**: Each file tracked independently by filename in Map
- **Progress events**: Emit `download-progress-{serverId}` with fileName, bytesRead, totalBytes, progress%
- **UI feedback**: Progress bar appears inline, replaces Download button during transfer
- **Fork handling**: INFO fork read and skipped, DATA fork saved to Downloads folder, MACR fork skipped

**Testing status:**
- ✅ Successfully downloaded multiple files (24MB and 31MB video files tested)
- ✅ Progress indicator shows smooth 0-100% progress
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous downloads work independently
- ✅ Files saved to Downloads folder and playable

**Next task:** Choose next feature from porting guide

  - Binary parsing of article list with metadata (id, parent_id, title, poster, etc.)
  - Support for threaded discussions via parent_id
  - Article content stored as plain text
- **Text Encoding**: MacOS Roman (MACINTOSH encoding) with fallback to UTF-8
  - Classic Mac OS used \r (carriage return) for line breaks, converted to \n for HTML rendering
  - Preserves ASCII art formatting in message board and news articles
- **UI Design**:
  - Board: Single panel with posts list + composer
  - News: Two-panel split (left: categories/articles, right: viewer/composer)

- **ServerMessage (104)**: Receives both server broadcasts and private messages
  - Presence of userID field indicates private message from specific user
  - Absence of userID field indicates server broadcast message
- **Event filtering**: Frontend listens to `private-message-{serverId}` events and filters by userId
- **UI Design**: Modal dialog with chat bubbles (blue for outgoing, gray for incoming)
- **User interaction**: Double-click any user in user list to open message dialog
- **Message tracking**: Component state manages message history per conversation

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- Using Zustand for frontend state (lightweight, good TypeScript support)
- Per-server state uses factory pattern: `createServerStore(serverId)`
- Rust backend manages active connections in AppState

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- Dark mode support built-in

### Protocol Strategy
- Building Hotline protocol fresh in Rust (not direct Swift translation)
- Using Swift implementation as reference for protocol details
- Designed for Tauri's async event system from the start

---

## Notes

- Initial Rust build took ~40s (lots of dependencies)
- Hot reload working for both Rust and React changes
- Default port 5500 for Hotline servers
- Using crypto.randomUUID() for bookmark IDs
