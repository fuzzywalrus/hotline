### 2025-12-11: Transaction Fix & Server Window UI

**What was completed:**
- Fixed critical bug in transaction encoding (totalSize/dataSize were incorrectly calculated)
- Successfully tested connection to live server (hotline.semihosted.xyz:5500)
- Implemented Server Window UI with chat interface
- Wired up Connect button in bookmark list to open server windows
- Added server state management (activeServers, serverInfo map)
- Implemented chat message sending

**Bug Fix Details:**
- **Problem**: Login transaction was hanging - server wasn't responding
- **Root Cause**: Transaction header had `totalSize = HEADER_SIZE + data_size` when it should be `totalSize = data_size`
- **Fix**: Both `totalSize` and `dataSize` fields now correctly contain only the length of field data (not including the 20-byte header)
- **File**: `src-tauri/src/protocol/transaction.rs:127-128`

**Connection Flow:**
1. User clicks "Connect" on bookmark in TrackerWindow
2. `connect_to_server` command creates HotlineClient and calls `connect()`
3. Client performs TCP handshake (TRTP+HOTL) then login transaction
4. On success, server ID added to activeServers and ServerWindow opens
5. User can send chat messages via the chat input

**Files created/modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/transaction.rs` - Fixed totalSize calculation
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - NEW: Chat UI with send functionality
- `src/components/tracker/BookmarkList.tsx` - Added connect handler
- `src/stores/appStore.ts` - Added serverInfo Map for tracking server details
- `src/App.tsx` - Routes between TrackerWindow and ServerWindow

**Testing Status:**
- ✅ Connection to hotline.semihosted.xyz:5500 successful
- ✅ Handshake and login working
- ✅ Server window opens and displays
- ✅ Chat messages can be sent
- ✅ Chat message receiving implemented (see next section)

**Next task:** ~~Implement chat message receiving with Tauri events~~ (Completed)

### 2025-12-11: Chat Message Receiving & Display

**What was completed:**
- Event forwarding from Rust backend to frontend via Tauri events
- Chat message receiving and display in real-time
- Visual distinction between own messages (green) and others (blue)
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Message timestamp tracking

**Files modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/state/mod.rs` - Added event forwarding task that emits Tauri events
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added event listeners and message display

**Implementation details:**
- Backend spawns tokio task to forward HotlineClient events to frontend
- Uses Tauri's `app_handle.emit()` to send events with server-specific channels
- Frontend listens to `chat-message-{serverId}` events
- Messages stored in component state and displayed in scrollable list
- Own messages added immediately on send (server doesn't echo back)

**Next task:** Fix chat message sending (messages were hanging)

### 2025-12-11: TCP Stream Splitting Fix

**What was completed:**
- Fixed critical deadlock issue where chat messages would hang
- Split TcpStream into separate read/write halves for concurrent access
- Updated all client methods to use split streams
- Messages now send immediately without blocking

**Bug Fix Details:**
- **Problem**: Chat messages would hang when sent, only appearing after disconnect
- **Root Cause**: Receive loop held stream lock while blocked on read, preventing send from acquiring lock
- **Solution**: Split TcpStream using `into_split()` to create OwnedReadHalf and OwnedWriteHalf
- **Impact**: Send and receive operations can now happen concurrently

**Files modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client.rs` - Complete refactor of stream management
  - Changed from `stream: Arc<Mutex<Option<TcpStream>>>`
  - To `read_half` and `write_half` as separate Arc<Mutex<>> fields
  - Updated all methods: connect, handshake, login, disconnect, receive_loop, keepalive, send_chat

**Next task:** Implement user list

### 2025-12-11: User List Implementation

**What was completed:**
- GetUserNameList transaction to request connected users
- UserNameWithInfo field parsing (user ID, icon ID, username)
- Real-time user list display in sidebar
- User join/leave/change event handling
- User count display in header

**Files modified:**
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added User interface, state, and event listeners
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client.rs` - Added get_user_list() method and parse_user_info() helper
- `src-tauri/src/state/mod.rs` - Added event forwarding for UserJoined, UserLeft, UserChanged

**Implementation details:**
- GetUserNameList (transaction type 300) sent after login
- Server replies with UserNameWithInfo fields containing 8-byte header + username
- Each user parsed and emitted as UserJoined event
- Frontend displays users with icon IDs and names in sidebar
- Real-time updates as users join, leave, or change info

**Next task:** File browsing

### 2025-12-11: File Browsing Implementation

**What was completed:**
- Tabbed interface (Chat / Files) in ServerWindow
- GetFileNameList transaction (type 200)
- FileNameWithInfo field parsing (20-byte header format)
- File and folder display with icons
- Breadcrumb path navigation
- Double-click folder navigation
- FilePath encoding for nested folder access

**Files created/modified:**
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added Files tab, file list UI, breadcrumb navigation
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client.rs` - Added get_file_list(), parse_file_info(), FileInfo struct, FileList event

- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Added get_file_list command
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Registered get_file_list command

**Implementation details:**
- FileNameWithInfo format: 4 bytes type + 4 bytes creator + 4 bytes size + 4 bytes reserved + 2 bytes flags + 2 bytes name_len + name
- FilePath encoding: 2 bytes count + for each: [0x00, 0x00] separator + 1 byte length + name
- Files vs folders detected by type field "fldr"
- Real-time file list updates on path changes
- Breadcrumb navigation for easy path traversal

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed FilePath encoding (needed separator bytes and single-byte length)
- Fixed React duplicate key warning (using file.name instead of index)
- Fixed double-click event propagation

**Testing:**
- Successfully navigated Apple Archive → 1980s → '80 → video files
- File sizes correctly displayed
- Folder navigation working smoothly

**Next task:** File downloads or other features

### 2025-12-11: Tailwind CSS v3 Integration

**What was completed:**
- Fixed Tailwind CSS not rendering (downgraded from v4 to v3)
- Configured PostCSS with CommonJS module format
- All UI styles now rendering correctly

**Bug Fix Details:**
- **Problem**: Tailwind classes attached but CSS not rendering
- **Root Cause**: Tailwind v4 has different PostCSS integration requirements
- **Solution**: Downgraded to Tailwind v3, renamed postcss.config.js to .cjs, added CSS import to main.tsx

**Files modified:**
- `package.json` - Downgraded tailwindcss to v3
- `postcss.config.cjs` - Renamed from .js, uses module.exports
- `src/main.tsx` - Added `import "./App.css"`

### 2025-12-11: File Download Fixes & Progress Indicator

**What was completed:**
- Fixed FILP header parsing (corrected to 24 bytes from incorrect 16 bytes)
- Fixed file transfer port (using port+1 as per protocol spec)
- Fixed file transfer handshake format (HTXF + ref_num + 0 + 0 = 16 bytes)
- Fixed DATA fork size handling (use file list size when fork header shows 0)
- Implemented download progress indicator with throttled updates
- Support for multiple simultaneous file downloads

**Bug Fix Details:**
- **FILP Header Structure**: Format (4) + version (2) + reserved (16) + fork count (2) = 24 bytes total
  - Previously was reading only 16 bytes, causing fork headers to be read 8 bytes too early
  - Fork type "INFO" was appearing in wrong position
- **File Transfer Port**: File transfers use server port + 1 (e.g., 5501 for main port 5500)
  - Discovered from Swift reference code (HotlineFileDownloadClient.swift:138)
- **Handshake Format**: HTXF (4) + referenceNumber (4) + 0 (4) + 0 (4) = 16 bytes
  - Not 20 bytes as initially attempted
- **DATA Fork Size**: Some servers send DATA fork with size=0 in header
  - Fall back to file list size (from FileNameWithInfo) when fork header shows 0
  - Log warning when sizes don't match for debugging

**Files modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client.rs` - Fixed FILP header (24 bytes), added chunked reading with progress callback
- `src-tauri/src/state/mod.rs` - Added progress event emission with filename
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added progress bar UI with per-file tracking

**Implementation details:**
- **Progress tracking**: Reads data in 64KB chunks, emits progress every 2% to avoid UI stuttering
- **Multiple downloads**: Each file tracked independently by filename in Map
- **Progress events**: Emit `download-progress-{serverId}` with fileName, bytesRead, totalBytes, progress%
- **UI feedback**: Progress bar appears inline, replaces Download button during transfer
- **Fork handling**: INFO fork read and skipped, DATA fork saved to Downloads folder, MACR fork skipped

**Testing status:**
- ✅ Successfully downloaded multiple files (24MB and 31MB video files tested)
- ✅ Progress indicator shows smooth 0-100% progress
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous downloads work independently
- ✅ Files saved to Downloads folder and playable

**Next task:** Choose next feature from porting guide

- FilesTab: Unique keys for files (path + name + index) and breadcrumbs (path segment + position)
- All components now maintain proper identity across updates

**Bookmark Stability Improvements:**
- Added `setBookmarks()` action to replace entire array (prevents duplicates on reload)
- Added duplicate check in `addBookmark()` to prevent accidental duplicates
- Changed TrackerWindow to use `setBookmarks()` when loading from disk
- Bookmarks now load once without duplicates, state stays in sync with disk

**Connection Error Handling:**
- Inline error messages appear below each bookmark (replaces alert popups)
- User-friendly error messages for common connection failures:
  - DNS resolution failures: "Unable to resolve server address..."
  - Connection refused: "Connection refused. The server may be offline..."
  - Timeouts: "Connection timed out..."
- Dismissible errors with close button
- Errors auto-clear when retrying connection

**User Icons:**
- Copied 629 classic icons from `Hotline/Assets.xcassets/Classic/` to `public/icons/classic/`
- Created `UserIcon` component with fallback to icon ID if image fails to load
- Updated UserList and UserInfoDialog to display actual icons instead of numbers
- Icons use pixelated rendering to preserve classic look

**Settings/Preferences System:**
- Created `preferencesStore.ts` with Zustand persist middleware
  - Stores username (default: "guest") and userIconId (default: 191)
  - Persists to localStorage automatically
- Created Settings UI with tabbed interface:
  - **GeneralSettingsTab**: Username input field with auto-save
  - **IconSettingsTab**: Grid of 629 selectable classic icons with hover/selection states
- Added Settings button to TrackerWindow header
- Settings dialog matches app design with proper dark mode support

**Bookmark vs Username Separation:**
- **Before**: Bookmark name was incorrectly used as username when logging in
- **After**: 
  - Bookmark `name` field only used for server display in UI
  - Username comes from preferences store
  - Icon comes from preferences store
- Updated Rust backend:
  - `connect_to_server` command now accepts `username` and `userIconId` parameters
  - `HotlineClient` stores username and iconId separately from bookmark
  - Login transaction uses preferences, not bookmark name
- Updated frontend:
  - `BookmarkList` reads preferences and passes them when connecting
  - Server display name comes from `bookmark.name` (via `addActiveServer`)

**Files created/modified:**
- `src/stores/preferencesStore.ts` - NEW: Preferences store with persistence
- `src/components/settings/SettingsView.tsx` - NEW: Main settings dialog
- `src/components/settings/GeneralSettingsTab.tsx` - NEW: Username settings

### 2025-12-12: Server Agreement Dialog & Banner Display

**What was completed:**
- **Server Agreement Dialog**: Inline agreement display in chat view (matching Swift app behavior)
- **Agreement Acceptance Protocol**: Transaction type 121 (Agreed) to accept server agreement
- **Banner Download Protocol**: Transaction type 212 (DownloadBanner) to request server banner
- **Banner Display**: Server banner displayed at top of server window
- **Event Handling**: AgreementRequired event forwarded from backend to frontend with pending state storage

**Agreement Dialog Implementation:**
- Agreement displayed inline in chat view (not as modal dialog)
- Banner shown above agreement text if available
- Expandable view for long agreements (max height 340px, expand button if needed)
- Accept/Decline buttons below agreement text
- Monospace font for agreement text to preserve formatting
- Chat input disabled while agreement is pending
- Agreement stored in backend state to handle timing issues (event may arrive before component mounts)

**Agreement Protocol:**
- Backend detects `ShowAgreement` transaction (type 109)
- Extracts agreement text from `Data` field (type 101) - servers may send in Data field instead of ServerAgreement field
- Stores agreement in `pending_agreements` HashMap for retrieval on component mount
- Emits `agreement-required-{serverId}` event to frontend
- Frontend checks for pending agreement on mount and listens for events
- On accept, sends `Agreed` transaction (type 121) - empty transaction, no fields needed
- On decline, disconnects from server

**Banner Download Implementation:**
- `download_banner()` method sends DownloadBanner transaction (type 212)
- Server replies with reference number and transfer size
- **Key Fix**: Banners use raw image data transfer (not FILP format)
  - Created `download_banner_raw()` method that reads raw data after HTXF handshake
  - Regular file downloads use FILP format, but banners are sent as raw JPEG/PNG data
- Saves banner to app data directory as `banner-{serverId}.png`
- Converts banner to base64 data URL for frontend display (Tauri asset URLs don't work with app data paths)
- Detects image format (JPEG/PNG/GIF) from file signature

**Banner Display:**
- Banner downloaded automatically after connection (when users list is populated)
- Displayed at very top of server window (above header) with dark background
- Max height 60px, centered, auto-scaling
- Uses base64 data URL for reliable cross-platform display
- Falls back gracefully if banner download fails (not all servers have banners)
- Error handling with console logging for debugging

**Event Listener Improvements:**
- Fixed cleanup errors for all event listeners (added `.catch()` handlers)
- Improved agreement listener with ref-based cleanup tracking
- All listeners now handle cleanup gracefully without console errors

**Files created/modified:**
- `src/components/server/ServerWindow.tsx` - Added agreement state, event listener, banner state, pending agreement check
- `src/components/chat/ChatTab.tsx` - Added agreement display inline with banner, Accept/Decline buttons
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client/chat.rs` - Added accept_agreement() method
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client/files.rs` - Added download_banner() and download_banner_raw() methods
- `src-tauri/src/state/mod.rs` - Added pending_agreements HashMap, get_pending_agreement() method, accept_agreement() and download_banner() state methods, agreement event forwarding
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Added get_pending_agreement, accept_agreement and download_banner Tauri commands (download_banner returns base64 data URL)
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Registered new commands
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added base64 dependency for data URL encoding

**Implementation details:**
- **Agreement Transaction**: Type 109 (ShowAgreement) from server, contains Data field (type 101) with agreement text
- **Acceptance Transaction**: Type 121 (Agreed) - empty transaction, just sends transaction header
- **Banner Transaction**: Type 212 (DownloadBanner) - returns ReferenceNumber and TransferSize fields
- **Banner Transfer**: Raw image data after HTXF handshake (not FILP format like regular files)
- **Banner Display**: Base64 data URL (`data:image/jpeg;base64,...`) for reliable cross-platform display
- **Pending State**: Agreements stored in backend state to handle race condition where event arrives before component mounts

**Testing status:**
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ Agreement displays inline in chat view when server sends agreement
- ✅ Agreement acceptance sends correct transaction
- ✅ Banner download works with raw data format
- ✅ Banner displays correctly using base64 data URL
- ✅ Event listener cleanup errors resolved
- ✅ Pending agreement retrieval works on component mount
- ✅ Tested with live server (Apple Archive) - agreement and banner both working

**Next task:** File uploads, server info display, or other features from porting guide

## Architecture Decisions

### State Management
- Using Zustand for frontend state (lightweight, good TypeScript support)
- Per-server state uses factory pattern: `createServerStore(serverId)`
- Rust backend manages active connections in AppState

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- Dark mode support built-in

### Protocol Strategy
- Building Hotline protocol fresh in Rust (not direct Swift translation)
- Using Swift implementation as reference for protocol details
- Designed for Tauri's async event system from the start

---

## Notes

- Initial Rust build took ~40s (lots of dependencies)
- Hot reload working for both Rust and React changes
- Default port 5500 for Hotline servers
- Using crypto.randomUUID() for bookmark IDs

### 2025-12-12: File Preview Implementation

**What was completed:**
- **Backend Preview System**: Created `read_preview_file` Tauri command that reads downloaded files and returns base64-encoded data with MIME types
- **Content-Based MIME Detection**: Detects file types from magic bytes (file signatures) for accurate type identification
- **Preview Support**: Images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP, SVG), Audio (MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, M4A, AAC), and Text (TXT, JSON, XML, HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Video Exclusion**: Video files excluded from preview to avoid heavy bandwidth usage on servers
- **Preview UI**: Preview button positioned to the left of download button, only visible for previewable files
- **Preview Modal**: Full-screen modal with image viewer, audio player, and text viewer
- **Preview Navigation**: Navigate between previewable files with arrow buttons
- **Preview Caching**: Cached previews for instant display on subsequent views

**Backend Implementation:**
- `read_preview_file` command in `commands/mod.rs`:
  - Reads file bytes and detects MIME type from content (magic bytes) first
  - Falls back to extension-based detection if content detection fails
  - Returns text directly for text files, base64-encoded data for binary files
  - Handles UTF-8 decoding for text files with fallback to base64
- Content-based MIME detection supports:
  - Images: PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, WebP (from file signatures)
  - Audio: MP3 (ID3v2 and frame sync), WAV, OGG, FLAC, MP4/M4A (from file signatures)
  - Text: Detected by MIME type (text/*, application/json, application/xml, etc.)

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Preview button in file list (only shown for previewable files):
  - Positioned to the left of download button
  - Only visible when file can be previewed
  - Eye icon (👁) with hover styling
- Preview modal:
  - Full-screen overlay with backdrop
  - Header with filename and preview type
  - Navigation arrows for browsing previewable files
  - Download button in modal header
  - Close button
- Preview types:
  - **Images**: Centered display with max height constraint
  - **Audio**: Audio player with controls and filename
  - **Text**: Monospace font with scrollable content
- Preview caching:
  - Caches preview data (blob URLs and text) for instant display
  - Cache key based on file path and name
  - Reduces redundant downloads and processing

**Files created/modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Added `read_preview_file` command with content-based MIME detection
- `src/components/files/FilesTab.tsx` - Added preview button, preview modal, preview state management, preview caching
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Registered `read_preview_file` command

**Implementation details:**
- **Preview Flow**: Download file → Read with `read_preview_file` → Create blob URL → Display in modal
- **MIME Detection**: Magic bytes first (accurate), extension fallback (for edge cases)
- **Video Exclusion**: Video files (MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, etc.) excluded from preview to avoid bandwidth issues
- **Preview Button**: Only shown for files that can be previewed (images, audio, text)
- **Preview Navigation**: Arrow buttons navigate through all previewable files in current directory
- **Caching**: Preview data cached to avoid re-downloading and re-processing

**Testing status:**
- ✅ Preview button only shows for previewable files
- ✅ Preview button positioned to left of download button
- ✅ Video files excluded from preview
- ✅ Image previews work correctly
- ✅ Audio previews work correctly
- ✅ Text previews work correctly
- ✅ Preview caching works
- ✅ Preview navigation works
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ⏸️ Needs testing with various file types on live server

### 2025-12-13: Sign-In Fix for Mobius Servers

**What was completed:**
- **Agreed Transaction Enhancement**: Updated `accept_agreement()` to include required fields for Mobius server compatibility
- **User Information Fields**: Agreed transaction now includes UserName, UserIconId, and Options fields
- **Immediate User List Request**: GetUserNameList is called immediately after agreement acceptance
- **Reply Handling**: Added proper reply handling with timeout support

**Problem:**
- Some Hotline servers (notably Mobius) require the `Agreed` transaction (type 121) to include user information fields
- The original implementation sent an empty Agreed transaction, which caused sign-in failures on Mobius servers
- Mobius servers also require a GetUserNameList request immediately after agreement acceptance to complete the sign-in process

**Solution:**
- Updated `accept_agreement()` method in `chat.rs` to include:
  - `UserName` field (FieldType::UserName) - Display name from preferences
  - `UserIconId` field (FieldType::UserIconId) - Icon ID from preferences
  - `Options` field (FieldType::Options) - User options (set to 0)
- Added reply handling with 5-second timeout
- Added immediate `get_user_list()` call after agreement acceptance
- Handles empty replies gracefully (some servers send empty replies)

**Files modified:**
- `src-tauri/src/protocol/client/chat.rs` - Updated `accept_agreement()` method with required fields and user list call

**Implementation details:**
- **Agreed Transaction**: Type 121 with UserName (102), UserIconId (104), and Options (113) fields
- **Reply Handling**: Waits up to 5 seconds for server reply, handles timeout/empty replies gracefully
- **User List Request**: Calls `get_user_list()` immediately after agreement acceptance (required by Mobius)
- **User Info Source**: Username and icon ID come from preferences store (set in Settings)

**Testing status:**
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- ✅ Agreed transaction includes required fields
- ✅ User list requested after agreement
- ✅ Reply handling implemented
- ⏸️ Needs testing with Mobius server to verify sign-in works correctly
