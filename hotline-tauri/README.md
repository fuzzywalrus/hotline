## About

Hotline is a classic Internet protocol and community platform from the 1990s that provided chat, file sharing, news, and message boards. This is a **cross-platform port** of the excellent [Swift/macOS Hotline client](https://github.com/mierau/hotline) by Dustin Mierau — a recreation in Tauri using React and Rust, with the original source providing protocol reference and inspiration.

### Why This Port?

While the original Swift version provides a native macOS experience, this Tauri-based client offers:

- **Cross-Platform Reach**: Runs on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and iPadOS (Android planned) from a single codebase
- **Long-Term Sustainability**: Built on widely-supported technologies (React, Rust, Tauri v2)
- **Broader Community**: Accessible to developers across all platforms
- **Modern Tooling**: Benefits from the React and Rust ecosystems

This project complements the [original Swift client](https://github.com/mierau/hotline). It does not include server software; for hosting your own Hotline server, see [Mobius](https://github.com/jhalter/mobius).

## Features

### TLS (Encrypted Connections)

Hotline Navigator supports TLS connections to servers that offer encryption (such as [Mobius](https://github.com/jhalter/mobius) v0.20+). TLS wraps the TCP connection before the Hotline protocol handshake, protecting credentials and data in transit.

**Per-bookmark TLS:** Each bookmark has a "Use TLS" toggle. When enabled, the client connects on the specified port (typically 5600) using TLS. Toggling TLS on/off in the Connect or Edit Bookmark dialogs automatically switches between port 5600 and 5500.

**Auto-Detect TLS:** An opt-in setting (Settings > General > Auto-Detect TLS) that automatically tries a TLS connection when connecting from tracker listings. When enabled, the client attempts to connect on port+100 with TLS first; if TLS fails or times out (5 seconds), it falls back to a plain connection on the original port. This works transparently — no user action needed beyond enabling the setting.

**Implementation guide for client authors:**

Hotline TLS follows the convention established by [Mobius](https://github.com/jhalter/mobius): TLS is served on a port 100 higher than the plain Hotline port (e.g. plain on 5500, TLS on 5600). TLS wraps the raw TCP socket *before* the Hotline protocol handshake — the protocol bytes on the wire are identical, just encrypted. File transfers follow the same pattern (transfer port = server port + 1, so TLS transfers on 5601).

To implement auto-detect TLS in your own client:

1. **Try TLS first, fall back to plain.** Attempt a full TLS connection on port+100 with a reasonable timeout (we use 5 seconds). If it succeeds, you're done. If it fails or times out, connect on the original port without TLS.
2. **Do not probe separately.** An earlier approach of opening a TCP connection to check if the TLS port was open, then closing it and opening a second connection for the real TLS handshake, caused the server to reject the second connection. Hotline servers (particularly Mobius) appear to treat the aborted probe as a bad client and temporarily refuse connections from the same IP. The correct approach is a single connection attempt — try TLS, and if it fails, try plain.
3. **SNI with IP addresses.** Go's `crypto/tls` server rejects the TLS IP Address SNI extension (`ServerName::IpAddress`). When connecting by IP rather than hostname, either omit the SNI extension entirely or send a dummy DNS hostname (we use `"hotline"`). Since Hotline servers use self-signed certificates, the SNI value only affects certificate selection, not validation — any value (or none) works.
4. **Certificate verification.** Hotline servers use self-signed certificates, so TLS clients must either skip verification or implement a trust-on-first-use model. We skip verification entirely (`InsecureSkipVerify` equivalent).
5. **Per-bookmark persistence.** Store whether a bookmark uses TLS so users don't pay the auto-detect timeout cost on every connection. Auto-detect is best suited for tracker listings where TLS capability isn't known in advance.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Account management and permissions
- [ ] Bonjour/mDNS server discovery
- [ ] Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- [ ] Message filtering and blocking
- [ ] Bookmark import/export

## Installation

**Platform support:** macOS (x86_64, ARM64, Universal), Windows (x86_64), Linux (x86_64, ARM64), iOS, and iPadOS. Android is planned. See the [main project README](https://github.com/fuzzywalrus/hotline#platform-support) for details.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 20+ (recommended for Vite 7 / modern Tauri tooling)
- **Rust** (stable channel)
- **Tauri v2** — [Platform-specific requirements](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Development

1. **Clone the repository** (this client lives in the `hotline-tauri` directory of the main repo)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fuzzywalrus/hotline.git
   cd hotline/hotline-tauri
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts the Vite frontend only.

4. **Run the full desktop app in development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

### Building

**Frontend only:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Full application bundle:**
```bash
npm run tauri build
```

**Windows build:**
```bash
npm run build:windows          # Windows x86_64 (MSVC)
```

**macOS-specific builds:**
```bash
npm run build:macos-universal    # Universal binary (Intel + Apple Silicon)
npm run build:macos-intel        # Intel (x86_64) only
npm run build:macos-silicon      # Apple Silicon (aarch64) only
```

**iOS / iPadOS** (requires Xcode and CocoaPods; see repo root for platform support):
```bash
npm run ios:init                 # One-time: generate Xcode project
npm run build:ios                # Build for device
npm run build:ios-simulator      # Build for simulator
npm run ios:dev                  # Run on device
npm run ios:dev:simulator        # Run in simulator
```

**Linux (including ARM64):**
```bash
# Add Rust target for native ARM64 builds (on an ARM machine) or when using a proper cross toolchain
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Build for x86_64 Linux
npm run build:linux

# Build for Linux ARM64 (aarch64)
npm run build:linux-arm
```

Notes:
- Cross-compiling from x86_64 to `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` requires an aarch64 cross toolchain (for example `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`) or using Docker/CI running on ARM64. For static MUSL builds you may need the `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` target and musl cross toolchain.
- The `build-release-linux-arm64.sh` helper script attempts to add the ARM64 Rust target automatically.

**Multi-platform release helper:**
```bash
npm run build:release-all
```
This runs the macOS/Windows/Linux build scripts in sequence and packages artifacts under `release/`.

### Quality Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
```

**macOS Requirements:**
- Both Rust targets: `rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin`
- Minimum macOS version: Big Sur (11.0)
- Universal binaries recommended for distribution

### Release Builds (macOS Code Signing)

For distribution-ready builds with code signing:

1. **Create `.env` file** in project root:
   ```bash
   APPLE_ID="your-apple-id@example.com"
   APP_PASSWORD="your-app-specific-password"
   TEAM_ID="YOUR_TEAM_ID"
   SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
   ```

2. **Run release build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:release
   ```

   This will:
   - Build a Universal Binary
   - Code sign the application
   - Verify signatures
   - Create a DMG (if `create-dmg` is installed)
   - Output to `release/hotline-navigator-{version}-macos/`

**Notarization:** the script includes commented `notarytool`/`stapler` steps you can enable for your release flow.

**Note:** The `.env` file is gitignored and contains sensitive credentials.

## Credits

This project is a port of the excellent **[Hotline client for macOS](https://github.com/mierau/hotline)** by **Dustin Mierau**. The original Swift implementation provided the protocol reference, UI inspiration, and feature set that made this cross-platform port possible.

The Hotline protocol itself was created by **Hotline Communications** in the 1990s.
